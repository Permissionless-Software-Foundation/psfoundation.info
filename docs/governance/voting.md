# Voting

[Voting proposals](/proposals) are announced in the [VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip). Voting tokens are air-dropped to each address holding a PSF Governance NFT. One voting token is air-dropped for each Governance NFTs held. Votes are tallied to achieve a 'yes' or 'no' vote on major governance decisions.

One Governance NFT translates to one vote. A single person can own more than one NFT, in order to achieve greater influence over PSF Governance decisions.
