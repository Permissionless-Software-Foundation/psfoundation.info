# Governance
At the highest conceptual level, the goal of PSF governance is to ensure that the people *most impacted* by decisions are the ones with the *greatest influence* over those decisions. That ideal guides all decisions around governance.

To make that idea less abstract: When new PSF tokens are brought into existence, it dilutes the value of the existing tokens through inflation. Therefore, the PSF governance is structured to give the existing token holders the most power over decision making.

## Org Chart
The governance structure for the PSF is as horizontal as possible. At the top of the organizational chart is the [VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip). Anyone can join the room, but only members who have cryptographically proven they possess a PSF Governance NFT are allowed to speak in the room. Governance NFTs can be purchased via the [BCH DEX](https://dex.fullstack.cash). New Governance NFTs are sold by the PSF at a price of 1,000 PSF tokens. Governance NFTs may also be awarded for acts of great contribution to the PSF. Anyone who obtains a Governance NFTs can participate in PSF Governance through [voting](/governance/voting).

There are four sub-committees that are accountable to the members in the [VIP channel](https://t.me/psf_vip):
- The Management - A small team of dedicated members who perform administrative tasks.
- The Minting Council - holds the keys used to mint additional PSF tokens into existence.
- The Technical Steering Committee (**TSC**) - drives the technical goals of the PSF.
- The Community Committee (**CommComm**) - represents the non-technical members of PSF which are composed of businesses, entrepreneurs, and users.

## VIP Channel
The [VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip) is where governance discussion takes place. After sufficient discussion and a rough consensus has been achieved, a voting proposal may be drafted to finalize and execute governance decisions. Anyone can join the VIP channel, but only members who have cryptographically proven they possess a PSF Governance NFT are allowed to speak in the room.

These short videos show how to purchase a Governance NFT on our DEX, and also how to register with the channel bot, to be allowed to speak in the channel. This will allow you to join in governance discussions.

## Subcommittees
Members of the VIP channel often participate in these subcommittees, but most subcommittees are open to the wider PSF community. Their purpose is to manage the relationships between the members of the VIP channel and the wider PSF community, in order to foster community involvement and achieve the high level goals of the [PSF Mission](/#our-mission).

### The Management

The management has historically been composed of three members. Contributors who wish to be anonymous will have their wishes respected. Their primary function is to maintain the code repositories and websites, and to pay out PSF bounties. They organize and execute voting proposals at the request of members of the VIP channel. They oversee the execution of the results of the voting proposals.

- **Head Janitor** - [Chris Troutner](https://github.com/christroutner) is currently the chairman of the [Technical Steering Committee](#technical-steering-committee-tsc). He manages the agenda and hosts the bi-weekly meetings. He is the largest contributor to the open source code repositories maintained by the PSF.

- **Business Development** - The role of Business Development is to meet with people in the crypto space and look for business opportunities to deploy PSF software. They are an evangelist, constantly trying to bring new members into the PSF.

- **Business Administrator** - Our business administrator prefers to remain anonymous. While their identity is a secret, their integrity and professionalism is obvious and appreciated.

### The Minting Council

The members of the Minting Council are chosen from the pool of Governance NFT holders. Minting Council members are added or removed from the Council through a vote of Governance NFT holders. While the VIP Channel may allow anonymous participants in the future, current members are required to be publicly known and trusted. Minting Council members are also required to be technically proficient enough to use the [psf-bch-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet) command-line wallet app.

Each member of the minting council is given an NFT. The NFT acts as a homing-beacon, allowing other members of the minting council to send the holder end-to-end encrypted (**ee2e**) messages.

Each member of the minting council holds a key to a multisignature wallet which allows minting of additional PSF tokens. The minting council communicates at a minimum of once per quarter to set the price of writes for the [P2WDB](https://p2wdb.com). They are the only group with the ability to bring new PSF tokens into existence, and they only do so at the direction of the VIP channel, after the passing of a voting proposal.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC) meets every two weeks on Wednesdays at 4 PM UST. They meet via Zoom and the meetings are recorded to the [PSF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ57IDXJJSYXHBLpF1tBD0g). Agendas are filed as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC/issues). Meetings are announced in the [PSF Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software).

### Community Committee (CommComm)

The [Community Committee](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/community-committee) (CommComm) is currently 'on hold' as the PSF looks for another member (or members) to host the meeting. The goal of the CommComm is to represent the non-technical businesses, entrepreneurs, and users. The CommComm handles marketing related activities and looks for opportunities to develop profitable synergy between the PSF members.
