# Governance
At the highest conceptual level, the goal of PSF governance is to ensure that the people *most impacted* by decisions are the ones with the *greatest influence* over those decisions. Everything else is a detail in the attempt to achieve that ideal.

To make that idea less abstract: When new PSF tokens are brought into existence, it dilutes the value of the existing tokens through inflation. Therefore, the PSF governance is structured to give the existing token holders the most power over decision making.

## Org Chart
The governance structure for the PSF is as horizontal as possible. At the top of the organizational chart is the [VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip). Anyone can join the room, but only members who have cryptographically proven that they possess a PSF Governance token are allowed to speak in the room. Governance tokens can be purchased via the [BCH DEX](https://dex.fullstack.cash). Their market price is free to float, but new Governance tokens are sold by the PSF at a price of 1,000 PSF tokens. Governance tokens may also be awarded for acts of great contribution to the PSF. Anyone who obtains a Governance token can participate in PSF Governance. One token translates to one vote.

The VIP channel is where governance discussion takes place. After sufficient discussion and a rough consensus has been achieved, a voting proposal may be drafted to finalize and execute governance decisions. [Voting proposals](https://psfoundation.cash/proposals) are posted to the PSF website. Voting tokens are air-dropped to each address holding a PSF Governance token. One voting token is air-dropped for each Governance token held. Votes are tallied to achive a 'yes' or 'no' vote on major governance decisions.

There are four sub-committees that are accountable to the members in the VIP channel:
- The Management - A small team of dedicated members who perform administrative tasks.
- The Minting Council - holds the keys used to mint additional PSF tokens into existence.
- The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) - drives the technical goals of the PSF.
- The Community Committee (CommComm) - represents the non-technical members of PSF which are composed of businesses, entrepreneurs, and users.

## Sub-committees

### The Management

The management has historically been composed of three members. Contributors who wish to be anonymous will have their wishes respected. Their primary function is to maintain the code repositories and websites, and to pay out PSF bounties. They organize and execute voting proposals at the request of members of the VIP channel. They oversee the execution of the results of the voting proposals.

- **Head Janitor** - [Chris Troutner](https://github.com/christroutner) is currently the chairman of the [Technical Steering Committee](#technical-steering-committee-tsc). He manages the agenda and hosts the bi-weekly meetings. He is the largest contributor to the open source code repositories maintained by the PSF.

- **Business Development** - The role of Business Development is to meet with people in the crypto space and look for business opportunities to deploy PSF software. They are an evangelist, constantly trying to bring new members into the PSF.

- **Business Administrator** - Our business administrator prefers to remain anonymous. While their identity is a secret, their integrity and professionalism is obvious and appreciated.

### The Minting Council

The minting council is the newest council, and it is still being formed. To be a member of the minting council requires a demonstration of commitment. The VIP group will determine the requirements for joining the minting council. Each member of the minting council will be given an NFT. The NFT acts as a homing-beacon, allowing other members of the minting council to send the holder end-to-end encrypted (ee2e) messages.

Each member of the minting council holds a key to a multisignature wallet which allows minting of additional PSF tokens. The minting council communicates at a minimum of once per quarter to rotate keys. They are the only group with the ability to bring new tokens into existence, and they only do so at the direction of the VIP channel, after the passing of a voting proposal.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC) meets every two weeks on Wednesdays at 4 PM UST. They meet via Zoom and the meetings are recorded to the [PSF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ57IDXJJSYXHBLpF1tBD0g). Agendas are filed as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC/issues). Meetings are announced in the [PSF Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software). Ask for an invite before joining.

### Community Committee (CommComm)

The [Community Committee](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/community-committee) (CommComm) is currently 'on hold' as the PSF looks for another member (or members) to host the meeting. The goal of the CommComm is to represent the non-technical businesses, entrepreneurs, and users. The CommComm handles marketing related activities and looks for opportunities to develop profitable synergy between the PSF members.

### Software License

The PSF uses the [GPL v2 License](https://psfoundation.cash) (the same as Linux) for our 'core' infrastructure software. [MIT license](https://psfoundaition.cash) is used for all other software, like application examples. The goal is to ensure everyone is free to hack-on, share, and expand our software. The goal is to encourage the growth of cryptocurrency and all it's freedom-enhancing promise.
