# About

The PSF is a loosely affiliated membership of entrepreneurs, crypto-enthusiasts, and JavaScript developers. There are two tiers of members:

- Ally: Anyone can join our [telegram chat room](https://t.me/permissionless_software) and stay up-to-date with projects promoted by the PSF.
- NFT Holder: Those who have purchased or been rewarded a governance NFT can speak in the [VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip), vote on proposals, and help steer the direction of PSF projects.

Members of the PSF often identify or have positive emotions around labels and concepts such as *sovereign individual*, *hard money*, *libertarian*, *free speech*, *entrepreneur*, and *privacy*. Both allies and NFT holders are attracted to possibilities of crypto technology to separate money from State, produce digitally scarce monetary assets, preserve privacy, and fight government overreach. If these ideas resonate with you, you should join the Telegram channel and consider participating in our organization.
