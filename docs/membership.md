# Membership

The PSF is a loosely affiliated membership of entrepreneurs, crypto-enthusiasts, and JavaScript developers. There are two tiers of members:

- Ally: Anyone can join our [telegram chat room](https://t.me/permissionless_software) and stay up-to-date with projects promoted by the PSF.
- NFT Holder: Those who have purchased or been rewarded a governance NFT can speak in the [VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip), vote on proposals, and help steer the direction of PSF projects.

Members of the PSF often identify or have positive emotions around labels and concepts such as *hard money*, *voluntarist*, *free speech*, *entrepreneur*, and *privacy*. Both allies and NFT holders are attracted to possibilities of crypto technology to separate money from State, produce digitally scarce monetary assets, preserve privacy, and fight government overreach. If these ideas resonate with you, you should [join the Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software) to learn more about our organization.

## Governance NFTs

Governance NFT holders are members who wish to participate in the [VIP telegram room](https://t.me/psf_vip), vote on proposals, and help steer the direction of the PSF organization. You can purchase a Governance NFT on the [BCH DEX](https://dex.fullstack.cash). They are pegged to the price of 1,000 PSF tokens.

If you need help or want more information on the Governance NFT, ask [the public Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software).
