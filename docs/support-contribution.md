## Paid Support

For businesses who need technical support or time-sensitive feature development or code-review, paid technical support is available at a rate of $100 USD per hour. Ask for more details in the [PSF Telegram Channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software).

## Donations

PSF software is maintained by paid developers. If our software provides value to you, please consider making a donation to support its maintenance, by sending BCH to the address below.

Any BCH sent the address above will automatically purchase PSF tokens at the spot price and burn them. This increases the price of the PSF token, which is used to pay developers.

## Contribution Policy

The PSF follows a [liberal contribution policy](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/TSC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) modeled after the [Node.js Foundation](https://nodejs.org/en/), and described in [Healthy Open Source](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951). Contributors who 'land' a Pull Request (PR) to one of our GitHub repositories is automatically invited to be part of the PSF GitHub group. They are then welcome to create branches and approve PRs from other contributors.

Software developers are encouraged to maintain their own fork of PSF software, so that approval of a PR does not become a bottleneck to their own progress. Pull Requests can sit for a very long time before they are reviewed, rejected, or merged. 100% unit test coverage is a goal of all PSF repositories, and so code submissions will frequently sit for long periods of time until they also include unit tests.
