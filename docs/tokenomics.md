# Tokenomics

The PSF token is issued primarily on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain, using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) for tokens. The Token ID below is linked to token information, including the current number of tokens in circulation:

- [36...token ID](https://psfoundation.cash)

There are currently plans to issue the PSF token on the eCash blockchain as well, but it has not yet been issued.

The [Minting Council](https://psfoundation.cash) holds the minting baton, which controls the ability to mint new PSF tokens into existence. The baton is held in a multisignature wallet, and each member of the Minting Council holds a key. They only communicate using encrypted messages passed over the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

## Token Liquidity and Peg

The PSF token is loosely pegged to the value of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The price of the PSF token (in BCH) is determined by an equation enforced by the [token liquidity app](https://psfoundation.cash), which can be interacted with at [PSFoundation.cash](https://psfoundation.cash) in order to buy and sell PSF tokens.

## The 'Nuclear' Option

A 'catastrophic loss' of the token can take many forms. Here are a few examples:
- The minting baton is accidentally destroyed, eliminating the ability to bring new tokens into existence.
- Token technology changes so drastically that the PSF needs to move away from the current token.
- A schism develops in the PSF membership, causing the organization to split into two.
- A number of Minting Council members conspire to inflate and embezzle PSF tokens.
- A State actor arrests PSF members and actively tries to shut down the organization.

Any imaginable catastrophic loss can be mitigated through the creation of a new token. Because the PSF runs entirely on open source software, anyone in the world has the ability to fork the code and modify it to work with a different token. This is affectionately referred to as 'the nuclear option'.   

The value of the PSF resides in its community, its mission, and the network effect of its users. The token is simply a coordination tool. Like any good tool, it can be upgraded and modified.
