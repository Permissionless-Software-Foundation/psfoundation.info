# Roadmap

Below is a roadmap of software developed by the PSF. While it's easiest to present the milestones in a linear fashion, most of these goals can be achieved in parallel. Dates are never used when presenting milestones, because the PSF is *not a company* that can make steady progress on any one area. Also, these milestones are rarely 'done', because they require steady maintenance over time. Instead, progress depends on the number of active developers participating in our open source community. Business members can accelerate development of any milestone by purchasing PSF tokens and paying developers with them.

## Milestones Achieved

- Create documentation to describe the [Cash Stack](https://cashstack.info).
- Create a proposal voting process using SLP tokens.
- Create end-to-end encrypted (ee2e) synchronous chat using Bitcoin Eliptic Curve encryption.
- Create ee2e 'email' allowing asynchronous communication with any BCH address.
- Create a mutable data protocol for SLP tokens, allowing changing token icons and tracking of changing data over time.
- Create a more reliable token indexer for SLP tokens.
- Create a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading SLP tokens.

## Milestones Under Development

- Fork the DEX to the AVAX blockchain and fulfill contractual agreement.
- Fork the DEX to the eCash blockchain and fulfill contractual agreement.
- Finalize a multisignature minting protocol and establish an anonymous Minting Council.
- Refactor chat.fullstack.cash to work with our web3 Cash Stack.
- Build a chat-bot interface for bch-dex. Add interfaces for chat.fullstack.cash, Discord, and Telegram.
- Add OP_RETURN remote controls to chat bot, so the Minting Council can drain and shut down the bots wallet.
- The Minting Council should establish two operators for our official DEX and bridges.
- Shut down the token-liquidity app at PSFoundation.cash and move to the chat bot as the primary way to exchange PSF tokens for BCH.
- Create a PSF token on eCash and build a bridge between the PSF token BCH and eCash for easy exchange.
- Build a bridge between PSF on BCH and the USDC.e stablecoin on AVAX, so the PSF can easily be exchanged for a stablecoin.
- Create a clone of Craigslist, but it operates on the web3 Cash Stack infrastructure and uses the Pay-to-Write Database (P2WDB) to store data.
