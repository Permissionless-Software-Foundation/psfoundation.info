# Communication

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is heavily used for communication channels, but the PSF maintains alternative communication channels and is prepared to combat any attempts at censorship or deplatforming. The following Telegram channels are maintained by the PSF community:

- [PSF General Channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software) is used by the general public to ask questions, and is used by the wider PSF community to discuss governance and news related to the PSF.<br /><br />
- [bch-js-toolkit](https://t.me/bch_js_toolkit) is the community technical support channel. Any software developers with technical questions can ask them in this channel, and any software developer with experience using PSF software is free to answer.<br /><br />
- The [PSF VIP Channel](https://t.me/psf_vip) is open to the public, but a chat bot ensures that only members who have proven ownership of a Governance NFT can speak. This channel is used to discuss major governance changes in the PSF.<br /><br />
- [PSF Social Chat](https://t.me/psf_social) is largely unmoderated. This is where off-topic ideas can be discussed.<br /><br />
- [psf-slp-indexer](https://t.me/psf_slp) is a Telegram channel to discuss technical concepts directly applicable to the [psf-slp-indexer software](http://github.com) or the [SLP protocol for tokens](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-1.md).<br /><br />
- [psf-dex-dev](https://t.me/psf_dex_dev) is used for technical discussion around the [bch-dex](https://dex.fullstack.cash) DEX software, and its forks for the AVAX and eCash blockchains.<br /><br />

## Alternative Communication Channels
PSF members are constantly evaluating alternative communication channels, in case Telegram ever becomes an unfriendly place for PSF members to communicate. The [psf-bch-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet) has commands for sending email-like end-to-end-encrypted (e2ee) messages using a combination of BCH blockchain and IPFS network. This is the primary way the [Minting Council](/governance/minting-council) communicates. This is our primary fallback communication medium, but we are also keeping our eyes on the following communication technologies:

- [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/) has tight integration with GitHub and is a popular communication platform for software developers. There are services for creating bridges between Gitter and Telegram.<br /><br />
- [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an anon-friendly chat technology. It's easy to create bridges between Matrix and Telegram.<br /><br />
- [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) is an up-and-coming social media protocol. It's decentralized and permissionless, making it an attractive communication medium.
