# Introduction

The [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.cash) is a community of JavaScript developers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. We develop and maintain business-focused cryptocurrency applications and communication software, based on the [The Cash Stack](https://cashstack.info). Some of our software consumes PSF tokens during operation, which allows us to maintain a circular economy with our open source contributors.

## Our Mission

The mission of the PSF is to help individuals protect their privacy, circumvent censorship, and engage in economic activity. The software we build and maintain is in service to that mission. In addition to heavy usage of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), we also focus on the use of three blockchains: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), eCash (XEC), and Avalanche (AVAX).

## About This Site

This website is open source, living documentation that any member of the PSF is welcome to edit. It describes the purpose and operation of the Permissionless Software Foundation. This documentation will evolve as the organization evolves.

This documentation is where members go to read the nitty-gritty details about the PSF:
- Tokenomics
- Governance Structure
- Communication Tools
- Our Approach to Open Source Software
