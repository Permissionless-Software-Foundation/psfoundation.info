If the PSF is successful in wide adoption of its software, and stays true to its mission, then it will inevitably be threatened by a State actor. For that reason, communication channels in the PSF straddle a pragmatic approach between convenience and self-sufficiency.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"governance":{"id":"governance","title":"Governance","description":"The governance structure for the PSF is as horizontal as possible.

While it\'s easiest to present the milestones in a linear fashion, most of these goals can be achieved in parallel. Dates are never used when presenting milestones, because the PSF is not a company that can make steady progress on any one area. Most contributions come from intrinsically motivated developers who are persuing their own personal interests, and try to give back to the PSF at the same time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"software":{"id":"software","title":"Software","description":"The core software maintained by the PSF is as follows:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tokenomics":{"id":"tokenomics","title":"Tokenomics","description":"The PSF token is issued primarily on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain, using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) for tokens.
